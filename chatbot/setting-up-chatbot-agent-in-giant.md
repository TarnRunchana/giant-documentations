3. The **Create New Agent** screen will be shown. Fill-in the following mandatory info in the screen:

   a) Agent ID

   b) Display Name

   c)Dialogflow Credentials

   ![create-new-giant-agent-details](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/create-new-giant-agent-details.png)

   Refer to the steps below for information on how to fill-in the above mandatory information:
    
   **a) Agent ID**
    
    	i. To get the Agent ID, go to Dialogflow screen and open Network inspector (PRESS F12).
	
        ii. Select Network tab > XHR.
	
   ![inspect](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/inspect.png)
	
        iii. Search the "agents" then you can see the ID in the red box. Choose one

        iv. Copy the ID from Network inspector into the Agent ID field in GIANT EXCLUDING the “-” available in the original Dialogflow’s Agent ID. For example:

			Dialogflow Agent ID: 5f1820b1-3783-4372-8603-ca06c4d59cbd
			ID to copy into GIANT: 5f1820b1378343728603ca06c4d59cbd
    
   **b) Display Name**
    
        This refers to the Name that you want to assign to your chatbot agent

## 1.3 Linking Intents to GIANT Chatbot Agent

To enable you to manage the responses for the Intents created in Dialogflow from GIANT, perform the steps below to link the Intents you created in Dialogflow with the GIANT chatbot agent. After that, you can manage the responses to display for the Intents from GIANT.

1. Access the agent in Dialogflow that you have linked to GIANT.
2. Click on the **Intent** that you want to link with GIANT.

   ![access-intent](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/access-intent.png)
 
3. The selected Intent will be displayed in edit mode. Scroll down to the **Fulfillment** section. Click on the arrow icon to expand this section. Then, click on **ENABLE FULFILLMENT** hyperlink.

   ![enable-intent-fulfillment](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/enable-intent-fulfillment.png)

4. Click on the toggle to **enable the webhook call** for the Intent. Click **SAVE** button to save the changes made. 

   *NOTE: You can also enable the intent’s webhook the first time that you create the intent. **THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP**. If the webhook is not enabled, it might be one of the reason(s) that you fail to get the expected response to show in the chat simulator*
    
   ![enable-intent-webhook](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/enable-intent-webhook.png)
 
5. Go back to the agent that you setup previously in GIANT. When you click on the **INTENTS** tab, you will be able to see all the Intents that you created in Dialogflow displayed in the screen. To refresh the list, you can click on the **Refresh** icon shown next to the Intents label.

   ![refresh-intent-list](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/refresh-intent-list.png)

6. You can now proceed with managing the responses for the Intent from GIANT.


## Pro Tips

Tips on things to do when things go wrong:

1. Check the documentation on debugging tips [here](./chat-simulator-debugging-tips.md) if your Agent, Intents or Entities are not working as expected.   

2. Ensure that the Intent's **webhook is enabled** after you make any changes to the Intent. Sometimes, it can get turned off somehow and this affects the results in Dialogflow's Test Console or GIANT's chat simulator.  

3. **Special note on Context** - the Intent that shows the parameter(s) collected from the previous Intent(s) needs to have the **webhook disabled** for the response configured in the Intent to show all parameters provided by the user. Refer to the documentation on [debugging tips](./chat-simulator-debugging-tips.md) for more details.  

4. If you **accidentally deleted** the **Default Welcome Intent** and **Default Fallback Intent** which were automatically created by Dialogflow when you created your agent, just add a new Intent with the same name to replace the Intent that you deleted. You can refer to the Pro Tips section [in this document](./setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-dialogflow.md) for the detailed steps. To know more on the default intents, refer to Dialogflow documentation [here](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents/default-intents).

5. If you **accidentally deleted** any of the intents in GIANT, you can click on the **Refresh** icon. GIANT will update the Intent List and include the deleted Intent by getting it from Dialogflow. After that, you need to **reconfigure the response** for the intent. However, if the intent is deleted both at Dialogflow and in GIANT, you will first need to recreate the intent in Dialogflow before refreshing the Intent List in GIANT.

   ![protips-refresh-intent-list](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/protips-refresh-intent-list.png)

6. You also need to refresh the Intent List in GIANT after you created any new Intents in Dialogflow. Newly-added Intents in Dialogflow **will not automatically appear** in GIANT's Intent List.

   ![protips-refresh-after-add-new-intent](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/protips-refresh-after-add-new-intent.png)


7. Ensure that all the parameters in RICH TEXT RESPONSE action for the intents in GIANT are get the parameter by adding a `$` infront. At the same time, ensure the parameter is configured in Dialog Flow parameter.

>> Sample Configuration:

>- Parameter Name in Dialog Flow: `package-type` 
  ![df-intent-param](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/df-intent-param.png)
>- Way to get parameter in GIANT Intent Response: `$package-type`
![intent-response-param](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/intent-response-param.png)

8. If you would like to configure the default value for specific parameter when user's answer hit specific intent's, you will need to create an event action in GIANT intent with specific condition to fullfill.


>>8.1 Create EVENT action in GIANT Intent

>>8.2 Add in conditions required to meet based on parameter (optional)

>>8.3 Configure follow-up event based on which follow-up event you wanted to attach to.

>>![sample-intent-event-name.png](./images/setting-up-chatbot-agent-in-giant-images/sample-intent-event-name.png)

>>8.4 Configure parameter name and default value.
